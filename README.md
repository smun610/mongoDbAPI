# mongoDbAPI
Basic Api Using MongoDB

This app was created to help me practice Spring boot with MongoDB. 

Run local instance of Mongo DB Add a new data expense_tracker, add new collection called expense.

Run app in your IDE and use swagger,http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/, to interact with the API without the use of postman.
